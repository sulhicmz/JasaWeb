# TODO — Rencana Implementasi (Revisi)

Sumber: `AGENTS.md` + `plan.md`. Checklist ini menyatukan tooling (pnpm, Vitest/Playwright, Prettier) dengan ruang lingkup MVP.

## 0) Prasyarat & Tooling
- [x] Node 20 (set `.nvmrc`) dan `engines` di `package.json`
- [x] `corepack enable` dan set versi pnpm di `.npmrc`
- [x] Konfigurasi lint/format: ESLint + Prettier (root) dan `pnpm lint|format`
- [x] Template `.env.example` (API, DB, S3, Email)

## 1) Workspace & Struktur
- [x] Inisialisasi monorepo pnpm: `apps/web`, `apps/api`, `packages/ui`, `packages/config`, `packages/testing`
- [x] Path alias & tsconfig base (root + per app)
- [x] GitHub Actions: Lint → Test → Build untuk PR dan `main`
- [x] Docker Compose dev: Postgres, Redis, S3 mock (minio)

## 2) apps/web — Astro (Marketing Site)
- [x] Setup Astro + Tailwind; struktur `src/pages`, `src/components`
- [x] Halaman: Home, Layanan (Sekolah/Berita/Company), Portofolio, Blog, Tentang, Kontak, Login ke Portal
- [x] CMS ringan (collection/content) untuk blog/portofolio
- [x] Form kontak + validasi + email trigger
- [ ] Target Lighthouse desktop ≥ 90 (Perf/SEO/A11y/Best)

## 3) apps/api — NestJS (Client Portal API)
- [x] Prisma + PostgreSQL; migrasi skema inti (users, orgs, projects, milestones, files, approvals, tickets, invoices, audit_logs)
- [x] Auth dasar: email/password + magic link; JWT/session + refresh
- [x] Multi‑tenant + RBAC (owner, admin, reviewer, finance)
- [x] Modul: Projects, Milestones, Files (S3 adapter + lokal mock), Approvals, Tickets, Invoices
- [ ] Email transactional (Resend/SMTP) + template dasar
- [ ] OpenAPI/Swagger + healthcheck + metrics endpoint

## 4) Packages Bersama
- [ ] `packages/ui`: komponen dasar + tokens Tailwind
- [ ] `packages/config`: eslint, prettier, tsconfig bersama
- [ ] `packages/testing`: test utils, fixtures, kontrak API

## 5) Quality — Test & Coverage
- [ ] Unit test dengan Vitest (target cakupan kritikal ≥ 80%)
- [ ] Kontrak API (`apps/api/tests/contracts`) dan snapshot stabil
- [ ] Tambah `pnpm test` di root; jalankan di CI sebelum merge

## 6) Keamanan & Kepatuhan
- [ ] Rate limit, CORS ketat, CSRF untuk form
- [ ] Hash password Argon2, 2FA TOTP (opsional MVP)
- [ ] Validasi & sanitasi upload; antivirus (opsional), ukuran maksimal
- [ ] Audit log untuk aksi penting + retensi log
- [ ] Backup DB harian + uji restore; kebijakan data (UU PDP)

## 7) CI/CD & Operasional
- [ ] Pipeline: lint → typecheck → test (unit/E2E) → build → prisma migrate
- [ ] Deploy: Staging (preview) → Production; variabel env tersentral
- [ ] Observability: error tracking, log, uptime; runbook insiden

## 8) Kriteria Penerimaan (MVP)
- [ ] Login multi‑tenant; user melihat data organisasinya saja
- [ ] Projects: CRUD + ≥1 milestone; Files: upload/download; Approvals: 1 siklus sukses
- [ ] Tickets: buat/update/status → email notifikasi terkirim
- [ ] Invoices: unggah manual PDF → status tercatat → klien dapat unduh
- [ ] Dashboard: tampilkan proyek aktif, tiket terbuka, link staging/prod
- [ ] Marketing site lulus Lighthouse desktop ≥ 90 (semua kategori)

## 9) Timeline Ringkas (10–12 minggu)
- [ ] Minggu 1–2: IA/wireframe, scaffold monorepo, CI/CD dasar, DB + Prisma
- [ ] Minggu 3–4: Design system, Astro halaman inti, Auth + RBAC dasar
- [ ] Minggu 5–8: Modul Projects/Files/Approvals/Tickets/Invoices + E2E
- [ ] Minggu 9: QA, security hardening, konten, migrasi awal
- [ ] Minggu 10: UAT pilot, perbaikan; 11–12: Launch, hypercare, dokumentasi

### SUMMARY OF COMPLETED WORK
The iterative analysis and improvement process has successfully addressed the major TypeScript compilation errors and architectural issues in the JasaWeb monorepo project. Key accomplishments include:

1. Fixed tsconfig.json base configuration and path mapping issues
2. Resolved import path errors across multiple modules
3. Created missing DTO files (CreateUserDto, LoginUserDto)
4. Fixed Prisma multi-tenant service implementation to resolve type conflicts
5. Updated service and module imports to use correct paths
6. Addressed decorator-related TypeScript errors
7. Fixed PrismaService event handler syntax issues
8. Updated audit and session services with correct import paths
9. Created initial Astro pages (Blog, About, Login) to complete the marketing site
10. Implemented lightweight CMS using Astro content collections for blog and portfolio content
11. Added contact form with client-side and server-side validation, and email trigger functionality
12. Implemented basic authentication system with email/password, JWT tokens, and refresh tokens
13. Set up Prisma schema with core models for users, organizations, projects, and related entities
14. Implemented multi-tenant architecture with organization context and RBAC system
15. Implemented core modules for the client portal API: Projects, Milestones, Files, Approvals, Tickets, Invoices

The codebase now has significantly fewer TypeScript compilation errors, with the number reduced from several hundred to just a few remaining issues related to the latest TypeScript decorator syntax and some third-party module compatibility issues.

This has made the codebase much more maintainable and ready for further development.
