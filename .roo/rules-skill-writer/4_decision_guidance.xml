  <progressive_disclosure_guardrails>
    <overview>
      Progressive disclosure is a tool to reduce token load and improve navigation.
      It is not a default requirement.

      Progressive disclosure is used as a pressure valve, not as a default architecture.

    <default_policy>
      <rule>Default to keeping essential workflow instructions in SKILL.md.</rule>
      <rule>Create additional files only when there is a clear benefit that outweighs added navigation/maintenance cost.</rule>
    </default_policy>

    <good_reasons_to_split>
      <rule>SKILL.md is becoming hard to skim (e.g., approaching ~500 lines) and readers routinely need only a subset of the details.</rule>
      <rule>The skill has distinct sub-domains (e.g., finance vs sales) where loading only one topic is frequently sufficient.</rule>
      <rule>High-stakes workflows need verification material (checklists, schemas, expected outputs) that is distracting in the main flow.</rule>
      <rule>Deterministic validation/automation is best expressed as scripts with clear run/verify loops.</rule>
    </good_reasons_to_split>

    <bad_reasons_to_split>
      <rule>Splitting purely for aesthetics or "nice folder structure" without a clear navigation or token benefit.</rule>
      <rule>Creating reference files that are always needed for every run (in that case, keep them in SKILL.md).</rule>
      <rule>Creating multi-hop chains (SKILL.md → reference.md → details.md) that require chasing links.</rule>
    </bad_reasons_to_split>

    <decision_test>
      <rule>If the skill cannot be executed successfully without reading a linked file in most cases, move that content back into SKILL.md.</rule>
      <rule>If only one section is "too big", split only that section (don't restructure everything).</rule>
    </decision_test>
  </progressive_disclosure_guardrails>

  <scope_selection>
    <default>
      <rule>Default to project skills under <workspace>/.roo/skills* unless the user explicitly requests global skills.</rule>
      <rationale>Project skills are auditable in-repo and easier to keep aligned with the project context.</rationale>
    </default>

    <global_trigger>
      <rule>Use global skills only when the user explicitly wants portability across projects.</rule>
      <rationale>Global changes can affect multiple workspaces and should be treated as higher-impact.</rationale>
    </global_trigger>

    <mode_specific_trigger>
      <rule>Create mode-specific skills only when the skill is intentionally scoped to a single mode.</rule>
      <rationale>Mode-specific skills reduce accidental activation and false-positive matches.</rationale>
    </mode_specific_trigger>
  </scope_selection>

  <breaking_change_rules>
    <rename_policy>
      <rule>Treat renaming a skill directory (and therefore the skill name) as a breaking change.</rule>
      <rule>Do not rename without explicit user confirmation.</rule>
      <rationale>Other instructions, automation, or users may reference the skill by name.</rationale>
    </rename_policy>

    <name_mismatch_resolution>
      <rule>Resolve directory/frontmatter mismatches before making additional edits.</rule>
      <rationale>Leaving a mismatch makes the skill hard to select and easy to break.</rationale>
    </name_mismatch_resolution>
  </breaking_change_rules>

  <resource_creation_rules>
    <rule>Create scripts/, references/, or assets/ only when they materially improve execution and the user explicitly agrees.</rule>
    <rationale>Extra files increase maintenance and can introduce safety/security concerns.</rationale>
  </resource_creation_rules>

  <handoffs>
    <rule>If the user asks for edits outside <workspace>/.roo/skills* and outside global skills management, hand off to the appropriate mode.</rule>
  </handoffs>
