  <example name="create_multi_file_skill_with_references_and_scripts">
    <scenario>
      Create a project skill that includes an entrypoint SKILL.md plus reference material and a validation script.
      The goal is progressive disclosure: only read references when needed, and execute scripts for deterministic checks.
    </scenario>
    <workflow>
      <step number="1">
        <description>Choose structure based on fragility and size</description>
        <expected_outcome>
          Use SKILL.md as the entrypoint, references/ for long-lived guidance, and scripts/ for validation/automation.
        </expected_outcome>
      </step>

      <step number="2">
        <description>Draft SKILL.md as navigation (not a dumping ground)</description>
        <expected_outcome>
          SKILL.md contains:
          - Frontmatter (name/description)
          - When to use / When NOT to use
          - A numbered workflow with explicit "read this file when..." pointers
          - A "Files" section that links one level deep:
            - references/SCHEMA.md (read when needing field definitions)
            - references/TROUBLESHOOTING.md (read when validation fails)
            - scripts/validate_input.(sh|js|py) (execute to validate intermediate outputs)
        </expected_outcome>
      </step>

      <step number="3">
        <description>Create references with table-of-contents style headings</description>
        <expected_outcome>
          Each references/*.md file starts with a short contents list so the agent can jump to relevant sections.
        </expected_outcome>
      </step>

      <step number="4">
        <description>Make script intent explicit</description>
        <expected_outcome>
          SKILL.md clearly states whether the script should be executed (preferred) or read as reference.
          The script produces verifiable output (e.g., JSON report or "OK"/error list) to support feedback loops.
